Although, any interested individual from area <span class="about__text--color">Kortrijk</span> is welcome.<p></p>We hope to offer you a collective of (inter)national students and others, interested in forming an active bouldering community. This not only means you'll have a chance to have pleasant and unique bouldering experiences (for the first time?) but you'll also have the opportunity to socialize and make friends with other people and students, local and international!<p></p>Who knows? Maybe you'll meet your future best friend here! We hope to meet you soon, spend some time together, and have you be part of our passionate climbing group!</div></section><section class="first-time landing"><div class="first-time__container" id="FirstTime"><h1 class="first-time__container--title">FAQ</h1><div class="first-time__questions"><div class="first-time__question-container first-time__question-container--unchecked js-container-1"><div class="first-time__question"><h3>How can I join?</h3><div class="first-time__arrow js-arrow-1"></div></div><div class="first-time__answer first-time__answer--unchecked js-answer-1"><p>If you want to become a member you can just send an email to <span class="about__text--color">ascendbouldering@gmail.com</span> for more information, or you can ask any member to refer you to <span class="about__text--color">Bram</span>.</p></div></div><div class="first-time__question-container first-time__question-container--unchecked js-container-2"><div class="first-time__question"><h3>When do you go bouldering?</h3><div class="first-time__arrow js-arrow-2"></div></div><div class="first-time__answer first-time__answer--unchecked js-answer-2"><p>This depends really.
